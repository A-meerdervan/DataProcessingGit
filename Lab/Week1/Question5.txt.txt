Git uses pointers to keep track of versions and a branch is a collection of such pointers. 
A new version is linked to the previous ones when it is committed.
When a user wants to keep the start of the project and build on that in two or more different ways, a branch can be used
than versions after the branching point are not linked.  
The head is a pointer that points to the current branch, one can switch the head.
This is a useful way to save diskspace because the alternative is to open a new project for each branch witch would use 
the versions before the branching point twice.
